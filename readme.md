# Floatplane Enhancer
Floatplane Enhancer is a browser extension that enhances the Floatplane experience by adding features, such as dark mode, or clickable timestamps in the video comments.

I'm mainly not a extension or web developer, so this is a learning experience for me. One of my first public extension projects, so to speak. I'm open to suggestions and contributions!

# Special thanks
