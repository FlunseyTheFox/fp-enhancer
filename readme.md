# Floatplane Enhancer
Floatplane Enhancer is a browser extension that enhances the Floatplane experience by adding features, such as dark mode, or clickable timestamps in the video comments.

I'm mainly not a extension or web developer, so this is a learning experience for me. One of my first public extension projects, so to speak. I'm open to suggestions and contributions!

### Note:
This extension has two manifest files, one for Chromium and one for Firefox. The Chrome manifest is located in `/chrome/manifest.json` and the Firefox manifest is in `/firefox/manifest.json`. The Firefox manifest is a copy of the Chrome manifest but is compatible with Firefox (using Manifest v2).

# Special thanks
Special thanks to [GradientCat](https://gc.omg.lol/) for the *stunning* icon!

Some aspects of the extension were redefined or generated by [Github CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Used for troubleshooting issues and generating some code snippets/commenting during development. *(Extension for Visual Studio Code)*
